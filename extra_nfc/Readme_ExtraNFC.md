## Extra NFC code

This code is made extra for inserting data into the NFC tag. In it we write a hexadecimal value into the tag and read it back out in the other code.
In the Read_NFC_Data we read out the hexadecimal value but also convert it to a decimal and string value and read it out as well.  
This code was not used for "Het Kompas" project, but is optional.

In next video a short demonstration of the code: https://youtu.be/4iU9dGybslI
