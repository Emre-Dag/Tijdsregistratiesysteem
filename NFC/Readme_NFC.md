## NFC Code

In this code we read in the Uid from the NFC tag and if this Uid is in the student default table it will be put in there with the associated information. If this Uid is not recognized it is also not going to be added to the table. With this, a zoomer also goes off as an indication that the student has dialed in.  
This code was used for "Het Kompas" project.

In the following link a demonstration of the code: https://youtu.be/JGaI_PJade0  (the same video as in the readme [website Folder](https://github.com/Emre-Dag/Tijdsregistratiesysteem/tree/main/Website))
