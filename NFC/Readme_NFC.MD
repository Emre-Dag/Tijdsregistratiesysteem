## NFC Code

The purpose of this code is to put the rasberry pi 3 somewhere depending on where "Het Kompas" wants to put it. 
In this code we read in the Uid from the NFC tag and if this Uid is in the student default table it will be put in there with the associated information. If this Uid is not recognized it is also not going to be added to the table. With this, a zoomer also goes off as an indication that the student has dialed in.
